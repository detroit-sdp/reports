# Project plan notes
## Relevance of the system
- Is there a need / potential market?
- Has anyone done anything similar?

## High-level description
- Describe the robot in terms of user stories
- User stories:
  - Waking a patient up at a pre-specified time
  - Checking the patient's medication at a pre-specified time
	- Come to room, ask for pills (using arm), take photo, send to nurse for verification, give back to patient (and possibly give water?)
    - This could be broken up into multiple user stories
  - Checking up on the patient when asked to by the nurse
	- Modes for if the patient is ok / not ok and what it does in each case
- Could we include a flowchart here or similar - of the various states of the robot?

## Milestones and task decomposition
- What are the main technical subgoals?
  - Do based on user stories
  - For each subgoal: what you should have achieved, what date, what evidence you will show
  - Keep in mind demo dates:
	1. Feb 5th
	2. Feb 26th
	3. March 11th 
	4. March 30th
  - For each milestone - decompose into atomic tasks: name, one-sentence description, estimated time for completion 
	- As a table
    - Mention dependencies - which tasks need to be done beforehand?
    - Gantt chart

## Resource distribution
- How will we deploy 200 hours per group member?
  - Take into account scheduled sessions, and time used in planning / presenting
- What resources do we have available?

## Risk assessment
- What risks do we anticipate? What contingency planning will we do against them?

## Group organization
- What roles are group members taking?
  - Intention is to split the team into two sub-teams: hardware, software
  - Strongly functional organizational structure
  - Each team will have a dedicated POC for co-ordinating with the other team
  - Who will be in each team?
	- Hardware: Rebecca, Jakub, Wojtek, Luukas, Errikos 
    - Software: Ben, Theo, Errikos, Yuchen, Ching Ling
- How will we communicate with each other?
  - Meetings:
	- First two weeks are daily meetings
    - Afterwards - sub-teams will have meetings as needed (min. weekly) and POC from each team will meet weekly on progress
  - Communication:
	- Primarly using Slack channel (detroit15.slack.com)
  - Code sharing:
	- Collaboration using GitHub (github.com/detroit-sdp)
  - Task allocation:
	- GitHub project boards per section (example: github.com/detroit-sdp/reports/projects/1)
    - Kanban-style (to do, in progress, done)
    - Also covers progress tracking
      - Update on progress in meetings
