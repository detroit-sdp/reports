\section{Project plan update}
List each goal set for this demo, appended with achieved, partly achieved, not achieved.
\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf TODO write up}
\end{itemize}

Concisely summarize reasons for deviations from achievement of intended goals. 
\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf TODO write up}
\end{itemize}

Provide one-paragraph description of how group organised work towards the goals: which group members worked on which aspect? How did we ensure effective group work?
\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf TODO who did what}
\item Moving Rebecca off hardware to longer-term planning + user surveys; Yuchen taking over app development; Theo moving to UI/UX work; Ben taking lead on robot coding; 
\end{itemize}

Provide summary of budget spent so far.
\begin{itemize}
\item 1h45m of technician time
\item To build the lift: 8 + 2 + 2 + 5 = \pounds 17 (+ \pounds 37.5 of Lego)
\end{itemize}

Provide clear statement for any modification you wish to make to your goals for the next demonstration.
\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf TODO decide next goals}
\item Big change: moving user testing forward as much as possible so we can get as much done as we can
\end{itemize}

\section{Technical details}
Describe technical details of current implementation. Provide clear justification for design decisions, with brief reference to alternatives considered or explored.

\subsection{Hardware}
\begin{itemize}
\item Scissor lift designed + built 
\item Include pictures: at rest, fully extended, detail of mounts, detail of metal supports
\item Maximum weight identified + stress points identified
\item Stress points reinforced (by what?)
\item Mounting system designed + manufactured for mounting lift to Turtlebot 
\item Struts added to Turtlebot to mount lift (but mounting not finalized)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Software}
\begin{itemize}
\item Autonomous mapping implemented
\item Autonomous movement implemented 
\item Server set up to allow communication with app
\end{itemize}

\subsection{App}
\begin{itemize}
\item Implementation of key screens: calendar, map, dashboard
\item Include pictures of each screen
\item Patient prioritization
\item Possible dashboards prepared against expected use-cases: details?
\item User tests designed to evaluate usability
\end{itemize}

\subsection{User testing}
\begin{itemize}
\item Design of survey for speaking to carehome workers
\item Analysis of how survey will affect work going forward
\item Ethical approval requested (? - check with Rebecca - will be delayed with strikes)
\end{itemize}

\section{Evaluation}
Testing:
\begin{itemize}
\item Lift team quantitative analysis:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Can the lift get to the same height consistently? What's the margin of error to get to the max height?
  \item Is the lift stable with increasing amounts of weight?
  \item Can the lift handle off-centre loads?
  \end{itemize}
\item Coding team quantitative analysis:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Can the robot reach its intended destination (from different starting spots?)
  \item How long does the robot take to reach its intended destination (how far does it travel vs ideal distance?)
  \item How long does the robot's battery last? Does performance degrade as battery degrades?
  \item Do the struts added to the base impede the lidar? 
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
