\begin{abstract}
  Tadashi is an assistive robot for delivering food and water to residents in supported living and care home environments.
  In this demo, we demonstrate significant progress towards a minimum viable product (MVP). We integrate components of our system together, demonstrating a full use-case: the caregiver placing a delivery on the tray and scheduling the robot to visit a room; the robot navigating to the room; the lift extending on arrival and detecting that the resident has picked up the delivery using integrated weight sensors; the lift retracting once the delivery has been made, and the robot sending a message to the app to indicate this; and the robot returning to its starting point. We also discuss usability testing we have performed on our app to ensure it is usable by non-technical caregivers, and discuss future improvements to the app based on this. 
\end{abstract} 

\section{Project plan update} 
\begin{itemize}
\item Begin testing app with non-technical users to gain insights on accessibility and ease of use: {\bf achieved}.
\item Make changes to app justified against results of testing: {\bf partially achieved}.
\item Complete user interviews with caregivers to assess demand for project features and implement new features based on caregiver requests: {\bf not achieved}.
\item Physically integrate lift mechanism into robot body, and integrate lift control into robot control software: {\bf partially achieved}.
\item Design and manufacture a tray to place on top of the lift to hold items: {\bf achieved}.
\item Add sensor to lift to determine whether items have been removed: {\bf achieved}.
\item Refine robot problem-solving when stuck by tuning mapping sensitivity and obstacle avoidance logic: {\bf partially achieved}. 
\item Implement bi-directional communication between the app and robot: {\bf achieved}.
\end{itemize}

We were not able to complete user interviews due to delays in receiving ethical approval (due to strike action). We intend to complete these as soon as we receive the approval. We were able to fully mount the lift onto the Turtlebot and partially able to implement communication between the robot and the lift, but the last part of this was scheduled for Saturday and therefore not completed due to the team having to move to remote work. Likewise, we were able to tune the robot's movement parameters, but we were not able to fully test this because of the team moving to remote work.

  \label{tab:group-split}
\end{table}

We began the sprint with teams working the same as for demo 2 in order to refine individual components: refining robot problem-solving logic and movement parameters, refining the app, and finalizing the design and physical mounting of the lift. We then began focusing on the connections between aspects of our project. To do this, ad-hoc teams were created based on the knowledge each person had of the system they worked on, as seen in table \ref{tab:group-split}. To ensure effective collaboration, these teams met and worked in person, doing pair-programming to ensure expertise could be effectively utilised and to reduce the need to spend time integrating or merging code. As with previous sprints, code was tracked using GitHub for version control, and group communication was done through Slack and once-weekly meetings.

Our total budget spending so far consists of:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \pounds 0 ({\bf TODO update}) on non-budgeted monetary costs, ie. items taken from the starting kit and therefore not deducted from total budget;
  \item \pounds 30.80 on budgeted monetary costs to improve the lift, leaving us with \pounds 147.61 in our monetary budget; 
  \item 3 hours of technician time to mount the lift, leaving us with 1.25 hours technician time remaining. 
\end{itemize}

Owing to the ongoing coronavirus situation, the entire team began working remotely from Saturday 14th March. This means we need to halt work on the robot and the lift, as we cannot access or run these remotely. Decisions are still ongoing as to how to continue work in this situation, so our goals may change as the situation develops. Currently, we aim to do the following for demo 4:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Complete user interviews, analyse results, and implement changes to our product to match user demand.
  \item Improve app based on usability testing, and perform another round of usability tests to assess if changes have made a difference to usability. 
  \item Explore other technical additions to the product to ensure our technical time is spent in a way that adds value to the product. 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{User interface}

\subsection{Software}

%Item 1
The app needs access to certain information about the current state of the robot. The information we decided would be most important is the state of its battery, as well as its current 'behaviour' in the world. These different status' are stored in a dictionary. We used a dictionary over a list so that we could assign our own code to each state. This would be useful later on if we need to separate errors from other status'. The states we included at this stage are: low battery, assistance required, at base \& not busy, moving, and arrived at goal.

% Item 2
At any given moment the robot knows both its own position (with respect to where it was booted up) and the map (again, placing itself in the origin on startup). The starting position can be altered, but we mapped from our 'base' so that this is the origin in the map.

The navigation stack takes a goal in and calculates the path to this goal. The goal is not a set of coordinates in the map, but a pair of distances on the x and y axes and a rotation at this goal. The problem is that you are not always moving from the same base due to goal tolerance allowing for some specified inaccuracy in order to save time, as well as natural drift. In order to correct this, we decided to have our robot take in the coordinates of the goal and calculate the vector from its current position.

As a further complication, the robot always believes that it is facing the front, so to speak. That is, while you can specify a rotational move using a quaternion (x,y,z,w), the robot will always think of its own rotation as being forward or (0,0,0,1). This means that the axes rotate with the robot in its own mind. Due to the obvious difficulties this presents when calculating our way back to base, we decided to restrict the robot to a four-directional goal system - forwards, backwards, right, and left with each having its own quaternion move (Table~\ref{tab:quaternions}).

We store our room information in another dictionary in Python. For this dictionary, lookup is important in order to verify that the target room exists. Lookup, insertion, and deletion are O(n) in the average case for lists, but are O(1) for dictionaries. This is not to mention that fact that it allows us to index the rooms however we please. Each entry in the dictionary stores the coordinates of the room, and the targeted rotation at this goal (L,B,F, or R), with the keys being the room numbers.

Based on observation, we believe that using the coordinates-vector system is more accurate over time than using distances. Due to the team not feeling comfortable returning to Appleton Tower in the wake of the global COVID-19 pandemic, we were not able to carry out official tests on this. Our test plans are detailed in Evaluation section of this report.

% Item 3
We found a parameter under the robots description of itself that it provides to the stack named <collision>...</collision>. We believe the stack uses this in order to avoid collision between the robot and the surrounding world. Furthermore, this tag features an attribute <box size> which was set on default to values very closely resembling the dimensions of the Turtlebot. We altered this to match the new dimensions of our bot. Specfically, the length of our bot is approximately 40.0cm as opposed to the original 28.1cm. Unfortunately, this is something that is incredibly difficult to test due to the robot avoiding obstacles very conservatively as a result of other parameter changes below, but no problems were encountered in general with the change.

The other key parameters are mostly self-explanatory other than the following. [min/max]\_trans\_vel is the speed of the robot when moving in a straight line. path\_distance\_bias determines how closely the robot need follow the path it works out. goal\_distance\_bias smoothes the trajectory of the path and makes it more efficient. Finally, occdist\_scale determines how 'afraid' the robot is of obstacles. All our parameter changes are detailed in table~\ref{tab:params}. Much like the coordinate system, initial observation would suggest to us that our parameters are more suitable, with official testing on the speed and accuracy unable to be carried out.

% Item 4
We had to establish a connection between the Raspberry Pi and the Arduino (lift controller). We reviewed multiple options including some wireless methodologies (Bluetooth, WiFi etc), but decided in the end that the fastest and most reliable method would be to use a serial connection between USB ports on each board.

The Arduino already possessed the code to operate the lift, so it was a case of writing a Python script that could read/write bytes of data over the cable. The Raspberry Pi sends a single byte to the Arduino with possible values from 0-3 indicating stop, extend lift, and retract lift respectively. The Arduino returns the status of the lift as well as the current readings from the two weight sensors.

The connection was initially unreliable due to synchronization issues. After they were resolved the bytes were successfully transmitted every time.

% Item 5
Most of the work in terms of getting the bidirectional connectivity established with the app was done on the app side. Once they were able to forward packets from the host machine to the emulator, our job was to handle the sending of UDP packets to the app when appropriate. The use of UDP for our connection and the reasons behind it remains unchanged. The system returns a packet to the app whenever the state changes. The packet simply contains one of the status' listed above and any logic for the handling of them happens on the app side.

For future presentations, we planned to next implement the Raspberry Pi inspecting for the {\bf STATUS ARRIVED} packet, and controlling the lift based on this. We also planned to have the robot retract the lift when items had been removed from the tray and return to the base after doing this. Finally, we planned to do testing for this demo as well as on our future plans followed by a general polishing of the product for industry day.

\section{Evaluation}

\section{Budget}
As with the previous demo, the bulk of our costs are associated with building, mounting, and integrating the lift. Tables \ref{tab:non-budget-cost}-\ref{tab:budget-cost-non-monetary} show spending to date including spending at previous demos. Equipment costs are based on values provided in the SDP wiki \cite{sdpcosts}.
